## How To Import a Theme

The themes are stored in the ``custom-themes`` and ``based-themes`` folders. Its pretty clear what its inside both...Once you have downloaded this repo, just follow the next steps if you are new importing themes into the dev-style eclipse plugin:
```
Open Eclipse:
-> Window -> Prefferences -> Dev-Style -> Color Themes
Then just import the themes that you want:
-> Import -> Select the .xml file of the desired theme
Restart Eclipse
```

> **Note**
> Obviously you must have installed the Dev-Style plugin wich is available in the Eclipse Marketplace as dev-style. If its not showing, try Darkest Dark Theme.

``v``:
